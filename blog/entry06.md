## Overall Takeaways from Expo & Presentation 6/7/24

In this blog entry, I discuss my takeaways from the SEP Expo and in-class presentations. My previous blog entries focused on learning Swift and progressively building the recipe app, which led to the expo and presentation where I showcased my product.

At the expo, I presented my [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wllvzgBhIc4V21Vb54pSE65B7uijQOkUwBu_c4Gucos/edit?usp=sharing) with my partners to the judges and all the students who came to see the projects. Though I didn't receive much feedback from the judges, I reflected on the Expo and had takeaways of my own. The first takeaway I had was to be more confident in my project. My partners and I found it hard to keep the people visiting interested as they didn't seem interested in our project. That inevitably led to us feeling that our project wasn't so great. I believe it reflected my confidence and pride in the cookbook app. I wasn't as enthusiastic as I should've been because I spent much effort on the final product. 

Another takeaway was to elaborate more on the reason for making a cookbook app out of anything. When I explained the cookbook app, I mainly focused on its functions and features, and there wasn't much of a connection between me and the app. I think it would've given the app a more personal feel if my partners and I connected the purpose of the app to our own daily lives. 

As for my [in-class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fzJTYPV8W36z7rmppDt6pjyQiK0mtnq6svw637Mek8o/edit?usp=sharing), a takeaway that I gained from the presentation was to project my voice louder. I started strong, but I felt my volume started decreasing after some time. As for the other presentation components, I think my partners and I did pretty well. We explained everything on the slides, and it didn't seem too confusing to the audience. We did a good job of explaining all the features of the product and how we were able to get to the final product.

I am currently in stages 7 and 8 of the EDP, where I am improving the cookbook app as needed and communicating my results/updates to the app. The app currently has a feature that is still incomplete. There is a tab page for the user to input their recipes; however, the app doesn't have the ability to save the recipes. That'll be an area of improvement for my partners and me. As for showcasing the product results, I communicated my results through the Expo with many people and through the in-class presentation, where my partners and I could show the app's process and results.

I gained skills in _embracing failure_ and _communication_ from both the Expo and the in-class presentations. My partners and I were fortunate enough to be selected as finalists for the SEP showcase, but that doesn't mean we didn't embrace failures. We still had room for improvement in terms of elaborating more on the purpose of our app. Through failure, there is growth. Communication was the key to completion in both the Expo and in-class presentation. My partners and I needed to coordinate who presented which slide/line and who was to follow and seamlessly transition.
