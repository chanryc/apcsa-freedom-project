## Project Idea and Tool 11/13/23

A project always begins with an idea and a tool to go along with. Amongst the many tools, I decided to go with (Swift)[https://developer.apple.com/swift/]. My project idea is  a cookbook recipe app that can store recipes for numerous dishes as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Along with the recipe app, there would be an Arduino that can help the user prep ingredients for the cooking. Since I want the app to be IOS, it would be right for me to use Swift because Swift will allow me to build IOS apps. I explored further into Swift by watching videos and learning bits about Swift.
