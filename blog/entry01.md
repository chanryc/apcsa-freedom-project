## Project Idea and Tool 11/13/23

A project always begins with an idea and a tool to go along with. Amongst the many tools, I decided to go with [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). My project idea is a cookbook recipe app that can store recipes for numerous dishes as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Since I want the app to be IOS, it would be right for me to use Swift because Swift is specifically designed for IOS. I explored further into Swift by watching videos and learning bits about Swift with a [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5PR3UyfTWvfacnfUsvNcxIiKIgidNRoW&si=c20m1ysmwPMlyfhs). I figured that Xcode would be necessary to make the IOS app, but I discovered Swift Playground on my iPad and I saw that there was an option to create a new app and here is what I saw: <br>

I researched whether it was possible to create apps through the Swift playground, and it seemed like it was possible. I saw it as an opportunity for me to tinker code in Swift without Xcode since I had no access to a Macbook. I followed along with some of the videos in the playlist on YouTube and I learned about variables and constants. The syntax seemed similar to javascript since it declared and initialized variables like `var str = "this is a string"`. Overall the syntax for Swift seems more modern and easier.

I chose Swift as my tool, but before that, I explored other tools like Unity and Flutter as well. Unity didn't fit with my project as much as Swift did because I found that it was mostly used to create 2D or 3D games and such, which didn't align with an app that stores data and displays them. As for Flutter, I did tinker with it using a [Dart Playground](https://dartpad.dev/). I followed a playlist of videos on Flutter and followed [this video](https://youtu.be/C5lpPjoivaw?si=dna4PQVGoVnQQeDT) to make an app UI:

Flutter was nice and all but an important part of the app had to be that the app was IOS, and if one didn't have access to Xcode, then it wasn't possible to make an IOS app. Luckily, an iPad may do just the trick and allow me to code in Swift without the need for a Macbook.

Currently, I'm in stages 1 and 2 of the Engineering Design Process, which are **__defining the problem__** and **__researching the problem__**. I have defined the "problem" as a need for a cookbook recipe app and cooking assistant. As for researching the problem, I researched the tool that I would use, allowing me to work on the "problem" in the most useful and efficient way possible.

Skills that I have developed in this blog entry are *how to google* and *consideration*. I thought about who would find the most use for the app, and I figured that would start with myself. A digitalized cookbook would be a useful tool in the kitchen. I had to google tons in regards to which tool I would choose. I didn't go with Swift at first because I couldn't access Xcode, and I wanted to make an app. Through all the tinkering with other tools, it strengthened my final decision with Swift.
