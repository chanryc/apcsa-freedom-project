# APCSA Freedom Project
by **Chanry Chen**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology. The purpose of this blog is to walk you through the steps I took to create my app as well as a few obstacles that I had to face throughout.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Swift** in order to help me make **a cookbook recipe called "Let Me Cook"**. Using all that I've learned from in-class as well as independently learning Swift, I was able to create a cookbook recipe app with my partners Yala, Hanna, and David. The app is used for storing recipes in categories ranging from meals to dessert. In each of the recipe pages, there are images, ingredients, instructions for the user to follow and be able to cook up a meal.

## Implications
In the ever-growing technological world, there's no doubt that a cookbook be made digital. The digital cookbook app allows for easier access to recipes for users to follow. It can be used anywhere and everywhere, making it more ideal than the traditional physical cookbook. While there are benefits to having an online digital cookbook app, there are bound to be disadvantages as well.
##### PROS
* easy access to recipes
* allows for endless recipe storing
##### CONS
* one would become too reliant on technology, and if technology ever fails, there's no backup
* takes away the love and experience of using a physical written cookbook
